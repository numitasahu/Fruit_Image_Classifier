# Fruit_Image_Classifier
This project focuses on developing a Fruit Classification System using deep 
learning. The goal was to create a model capable of classifying fruits based on 
images. The ResNet-50 architecture was employed with transfer learning to 
achieve high accuracy. 
 
Data augmentation techniques, including resizing, cropping, rotation, and 
normalization, were applied to enhance model performance and address dataset 
limitations. The model was trained and evaluated using separate train, validation, 
and test sets, with accuracy and loss as key performance metrics. 
 
A Streamlit web application was created for users to upload fruit images and 
receive real-time predictions along with probability distributions. Challenges 
such as a limited dataset, overfitting, and computational constraints were 
addressed using data augmentation, dropout layers, and GPU acceleration. 
 
The final model achieved high accuracy and demonstrated good generalization. 
The project highlights the potential of Deep Learning for real-world classification 
tasks, with future improvements focused on expanding the dataset and optimizing 
for mobile use.
